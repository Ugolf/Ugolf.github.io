```
Hello World
```
What will be the first **real** project to add here and keep it update here? It is unknown for him for now. He has a lot of ideas to implement, build, but he is too lazy. Too _bad!_ Let's change this! New year - new provisions. 
`return true` to sentence: _No more same day routine!_
